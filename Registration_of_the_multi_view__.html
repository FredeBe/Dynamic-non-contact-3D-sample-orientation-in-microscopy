<div><b>Registration of the multi-view, multi-axes SPIM data</b><br></div><div>Since the zebrafish is rotating in the chorion and the agarose does not change its orientation bead based registration techniques can no be used to register the multi-view, multi-axes SPIM data. To use the sample feature based registration the transformation between the different views had to be determined <cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Preibisch_2010,
