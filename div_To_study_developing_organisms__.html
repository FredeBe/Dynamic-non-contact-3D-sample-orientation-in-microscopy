study developing organisms with optimal resolution a technique to orient the
sample in the microscope in any arbitrary orientation without affecting the
sample integrity is needed. While different organisms may require tailored
solutions, the popular model organisms zebrafish is transparent in making it
the sample for in vivo light microscopy.<br></div>
