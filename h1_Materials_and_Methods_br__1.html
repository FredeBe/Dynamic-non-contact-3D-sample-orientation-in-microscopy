<h1>Materials and Methods<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" id="auto-label-subsection-469807"><br>SPIM setup<br></h2><div><div><div><div>SPIM setup consisted of an Olympus N4X-PF low magnification air objective for detection
and two cylindrical lenses aligned orthogonal to the detection for double sided
light-sheet illumination. The sample was illuminated alternately from two
sides. The alternating illumination was controlled via a flipper mirror (8892-K-M, New Focus, USA). The
sample chamber was 3d printed and had two windows for illumination and one
window for detection of the sample. The electromagnets were hold by the sample
chamber and assembled in a tetrahedral geometry to enable three-dimensional
control of sample’s orientation. The applied current was remotely controlled
via a programmable power supply (QL355P, Aim-TTi, United
Kingdom) and a manual
switch. The focus of the four electromagnet-tips coincided with the sample. The
sample was inserted from the top within a FEP tube  orthogonal to the
detection objective and to the illumination objective. To scan the sample the
sample chamber was positioned on a motorized linear stage (M111.1DG, Physik
Instrumente, Germany) and moved relative to the detection objective. To correct
for the different path length in water and air the detection objective was also
placed on a linear stage (M111.1DG, Physik Instrumente, Germany) and moved
accordingly. For wide-field illumination a LED is placed behind the sample. For
light-sheet illumination a single color (488nm) Coherent Sapphire laser (488-30
CDRH) was used. The wide-field and fluorescence signals were detected with a sCMOS
camera (Zyla 5.5, Andor, United Kingdom).<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Electromagnets</b><br></div><div>The electromagnets were custom-built and
consisted of a magnetic core made from HyMu 80 alloy (National Electronic
Alloys, USA) and a solenoid. The bobbin was made from Teflon and a high
resistance wire was wind up hundreds of times to create a high magnetic field.
The magnetic core had a diameter of 6mm and was tapered to create a strong
magnetic field gradient. The inner diameter of the bobbin was 6mm that the
magnetic core could be inserted.<br></div><br></div><br></div><b>Super-paramagnetic beads</b><br></div><div><div><div>The washed super paramagnetic beads
(Dynabeads MyOne Carboxylic Acid, Invitrogen, USA) with a diameter of 2.8 µm were injected
with standard glass needles into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo. The
injection needle was inserted from either the vegetal pole or the lateral side.
For a sufficient torque to turn the embryo it is important that the beads stay
close to the yolk membrane. Injections were performed at extremely low pressure
(5-10 psi) and long injection duration (100-150 ms) to avoid the dispersion of
beads. By applying a strong constant magnetic field after the injection of the
beads with a permanent magnet the beads are attracted and clump. This
aggregation of beads preserves the single beads from translating through the
yolk and eases the rotatio<br></div><br></div><b>Magnetic
manipulator inset for a stereoscope and inverted microscopes</b><br></div><div><div><div><div>The
 magnetic manipulator inset was build from a aluminum plate with a size 
of 92.5x64 mm fitting on standard microscope stages. On this plate an 
arc holding two electromagnets that can be freely slid along the arc to 
control the angle between the magnets and the sample. The sample is 
either embedded in a glass capillary to study it on a upright microscope
 or placed on a coverslip and held by a Teflon holder to study the 
sample on an inverted microscope. <br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div>
