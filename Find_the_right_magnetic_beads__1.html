<h1>Main text<br></h1><div><i>Need
to image sample from a specific well-defined angle</i><br></div><div>Inhomogeneous samples have an optimal orientation when
studied by light microscopy. For example in developmental biology highly
scattering tissues such as pigments, the eyes or the yolk can obscure the organ
or tissue of interest. To align the sample in its preferred orientation the
sample is carefully embedded prior to the experiment. However, after embedding
the sample’s orientation is fixed and cannot be adapted to the sample’s
development during in vivo experiments or to another region of interest anymore.

from several angles. In each view the area facing the objective lens is well
resolved. Consequently, in such a single rotational–axis system uniform
resolution is achieved only along the equator, which faces the detection lens. Therefore

position the sample in the focal plane of the objective but there is no control
of the sample orientation. The positioning technique must not interfere with
the imaging of the sample. The method should be automatable allowing the
integration in any automated microscopy routine. Ultimately, the technique has

forces are not high enough to position
a millimeter-sized zebrafish embryo.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Introduce the idea and show how you go
about implementing it</i><br></div><div>We tried whether we could use magnetic
forces to orient a zebrafish embryo within its chorion. To apply a magnetic
force on the embryo we injected magnetic beads into the yolk. We discovered that
we could orient the injected embryo within its chorion by approaching a permanent
magnet close to the embryo (<b>Supplementary
video S1).</b> The injected beads were attracted by the permanent magnet but the
zebrafish couldn’t translate towards the electromagnet since it was
encapsulated in its chorion. We found that by moving the permanent magnet we
can orient the zebrafish embryo contactless within its chorion.<br></div><div><div><br></div><div><i>Injection of magnetic beads</i><br></div></div><div><div><div><div>The super paramagnetic beads were
injected with glass needles into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo to ensure the
integrity of the zebrafish embryo. We
performed the injections at 4 hpf and the injection needle was inserted from
either the vegetal pole or the lateral side and beads were deposited close to
the yolk membrane (<b>Figure 1b</b>). We
found that performing the injections at extremely low pressure (5-10 psi) and
long injection duration (100-150 ms) avoided the dispersion of beads. By
applying a strong constant magnetic field after the injection of the beads with
a permanent magnet the beads were attracted and clump. This aggregation of
beads preserved the single beads from translating through the yolk and eased
the rotation.<br></div></div></div></div><div><br></div><div><i>Find the right magnetic beads to orient
the zebrafish embryo</i><br></div><div>To ensure the sample integrity no
residual force should affect the sample after it has been oriented. Compared to
ferromagnetic beads it turned out that super-paramagnetic beads show no residual
force once the magnets are removed since they exhibit magnetic properties

large enough that the beads are stationary and do not translate within the yolk
when a magnetic field is applied but they should be small enough that they can
be injected without damaging the zebrafish. We found that a bead size of 2.8 µm
allows a rotation of the sample with moderate magnetic fields without a
translation of the beads within the zebrafish chorion. The applied force on the
fish is proportional to the number of injected beads hence a higher volume of
beads is favorable but the injected volume may damage the zebrafish. We found that
a volume as low as 1 nl bead solution
corresponding to about 15ng of beads or about 1000 beads is sufficient to
rotate the embryo at low currents of 300mA.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Injection of beads does not alter the
zebrafish development</i><br></div><div>Injected embryos were monitored for 4 days and we found no visible delay or defect in
development when compared to non-injected wildtype embryos <b>(Supplementary Figure S1)</b>. As the embryo developed, the yolk was
being used with the beads staying in the remaining yolk, close to the yolk
extension.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>Magnets</i><br></div><div>The external magnetic field can be
generated by permanent or electromagnets. Although permanent magnets have a
higher magnetic field, electromagnets can be controlled by the applied current
and hence allow a dynamic adaptation of the magnetic field without any movement
of the magnet. The applied force on a super-paramagnetic bead is proportional
to the magnetic field gradient <cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Neuman_2007,

electromagnets to create a sufficiently strong magnetic field gradient, even with
a moderate current (300 mA). Heating of the electromagnets was also negligible.
We designed the electromagnets to be small enough to be oriented around the sample
in any geometry giving the freedom of full 3D sample orientation. To study
developing zebrafish from the optimal orientation we adapted our magnetic
orientation technique to a SPIM.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Why do we need more than one axis of

rotation about which the sample is rotated to take several views. However, a
single rotational-axis system cannot give the full three-dimensional freedom of
rotation. Therefore, not all parts of the sample
can be turned in front of the detection objective and are accessible, e.g. for
photo-manipulation.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Introduce the magnetic manipulation on
a SPIM</i><br></div><div>To orient the sample in three dimensions
at least four magnets were needed since every magnet acts as an attractor fixed
in space. Here, we included a tetrahedral electromagnet configuration in a SPIM
setup <b>(Figure 2a).</b> We designed a
sample chamber that held the four magnets in a tetrahedral geometry and the
sample tube.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Performance of the system</i><br></div><div>We measured the performance of the
magnetic rotation and found that a rotation of the zebrafish embryo within its
chorion from one magnet to another one (109.5 degrees) took less than 30s at a current as low
as 300 mA <b>(Figure 1d)</b>. This transition time from
one magnet to the next one was anti-proportional to the applied current and could
therefore be tuned according to the application. A low current led to slow and
homogenous rotation whereas a high current led to a rapid reorientation. After
releasing the embryo from the magnetic force the zebrafish retracted less than
10s and settled at its final position. We found that the embryo remained stable
in its settled position for over a minute longer than the time it needs to take
a three-dimensional stack of the whole embryo on a SPIM. Applying a low
magnetic force could stabilize the orientation of anisotropic samples in a
preferred orientation.<br></div><div><div><div><br></div><div><i>Intermediate angles</i><br></div><div><div>To study the sample in the optimal
orientation intermediate orientations between two/three magnets need to be
accessible. We found that these intermediate orientations could be accessed in
two different ways. First, spherical samples with no preferred orientation (as
the zebrafish embryo till the bud stage) could be stopped while rotating from
one magnet to the next one and settled at this intermediate orientation.
Second, by applying a current onto two or more magnets at the same time the
zebrafish oriented to the resulting magnetic field. By changing the ratio of
the applied currents between the different magnets the sample could be
positioned in any orientation in three dimensions. This method is especially
suitable to orient samples in an out-of equilibrium orientation<br></div><br></div><div><i>10 different orientations from the same
embryo</i><br></div><div>To obtain an almost isotropic resolution
across the whole zebrafish embryo we imaged the embryo from ten different orientations.
We took a stack for the four sample orientations given by the tetrahedral
magnet geometry and the six orientations for all the possible combinations of
two magnets. The resulting data showed no deformations and the embryo could be
imaged from ten different orientations <b>(Figure
2)</b>.<br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div>The&nbsp; FUSION is still missing!<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>Limitations of light microscope as
spinning disk</i><br></div><div>In contrast to SPIM, common light
microscopes as spinning disk are designed to image the sample from only one side.
To orient the sample in the preferred orientation and to study the sample from
multiples sides we developed an inset consisting of a plate and an arc holding
the two electromagnets.&nbsp; This inset can
easily be adapted to any commercial light microscope. &nbsp;Here, we show the in situ orientation of a zebrafish
larva (5dpf, kdrl?) on a stereoscope. The magnet orientation could be adapted
continuously by sliding the magnets along the arc. The sample was positioned on
the axis of rotation. The zebrafish larvae was embedded in a glass capillary to
prevent it from translating towards the magnets and to ensure the ball bearing mechanism. &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div><i>2 different orientations from the same
zebrafish larvae</i><a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/100587/articles/121901/comments"><b>
                </b></a><br></div><div>We used two electromagnets to orient the
zebrafish larva about its anterior-posterior axis making use of the elongated
morphology at the larvae stage. We found that the rotation of the zebrafish
larva worked best with an angle of about 35 degrees between the electromagnet
and the plate. By switching on one magnet the zebrafish was slightly translated
towards the wall of the glass capillary and rotated about 180 degrees towards
the magnet. By switching off the magnet the larvae was released from the force
and settled in its resting position <b>(Figure
3)</b>. A 180 degrees rotation from the left lateral to the right lateral
resting position about the anterior-posterior axis took not longer than 10 s at a current of 1 A. By rotating the
zebrafish larvae we can image the larvae from the right and the left lateral
side within a single experiment.<br></div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
