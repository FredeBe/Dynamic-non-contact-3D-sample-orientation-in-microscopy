<div>In vivo imaging of growing and developing samples requires a
dynamic adaptation of the sample orientation, which is not possible in most
light microscope after initial sample embedding. Here, we present a technique
that after the injection of magnetic beads can freely position the sample by
applying a magnetic field. We show its excellent performance for a zebrafish
larva on a stereoscope and a zebrafish embryo on a SPIM system. <br></div>
