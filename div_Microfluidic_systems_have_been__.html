systems have been developed to align many zebrafish larvae for high-throughput
applications in the preferred orientation<sup>1</sup>. By
embedding a zebrafish larva between two coverslips the sample has been studied
from two sides by manually turning the sample<sup>2</sup>. While
these techniques allow a precise sample orientation or to manually change it but
they still: did not allow an adaptive reorientation of the sample orientation. In
light-sheet microscopy (or SPIM<sup>3</sup>) the
sample is rotated about one axis with a rotation stage. The entire sample is
then reconstructed by fusing views from several angles. In each view the area
facing the objective lens is well resolved. Consequently, in such a single
rotationalâ€“axis system uniform resolution is achieved only along the equator,
which faces the detection lens. Therefore the lateral resolution at the polar
caps is no better than the axial resolution of the microscope.<br></div>
