<div><i>10 different orientations from the same
embryo</i><br></div><div>To obtain an almost isotropic resolution
across the whole zebrafish embryo we imaged the embryo from ten different orientations.
We took a stack for the four sample orientations given by the tetrahedral
magnet geometry and the six orientations for all the possible combinations of
two magnets. The resulting data showed no deformations and the embryo could be
imaged from ten different orientations <b>(Figure
2)</b>. <br></div>
