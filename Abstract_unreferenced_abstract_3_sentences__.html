<h1>Abstract <i>(unreferenced abstract 3
sentences, no more than 70 words)</i><br></h1><div>In vivo imaging of growing and developing samples requires a
dynamic adaptation of the sample orientation, which has been impossible in most light microscopes. Here, we present how, after the injection of magnetic beads, a sample can be freely positioned by
applying a magnetic field. We demonstrate its performance for zebrafish
larvae on a stereoscope and (zebrafish) embryos on a SPIM system. <br></div>
