<div>To orient the sample in three dimensions
at least four magnets were needed since every magnet acts as an attractor fixed
in space. Here, we included a tetrahedral electromagnet configuration in a SPIM
setup <b>(Figure 2a).</b> We designed a
sample chamber that held the four magnets in a tetrahedral geometry and the
sample tube. <br></div>
