<div>Inhomogeneous
samples have an optimal
orientation when studied by light microscopy. For example in developmental
biology highly scattering tissues such as pigments, the eyes or the yolk can obscure
the organ or tissue of interest. To align the sample in its preferred
orientation the sample is carefully embedded prior to the experiment. However,
after embedding the sample’s orientation is fixed and cannot be adapted to the
sample’s development during in vivo experiments or to another region of
interest anymore. <cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Jahr_2015,
