<h1>Main text<br></h1><div><i>Need
to image sample from a specific well-defined angle</i><br></div><div>Inhomogeneous samples have an optimal orientation when
studied by light microscopy. For example in developmental biology highly
scattering tissues such as pigments, the eyes or the yolk can obscure the organ
or tissue of interest. To align the sample in its preferred orientation the
sample is carefully embedded prior to the experiment. However, after embedding
the sample’s orientation is fixed and cannot be adapted to the sample’s
development during in vivo experiments or to another region of interest anymore.
<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>Define explicitly what the goal is
(with respect to your sample, zebrafish).</i><br></div><div>To study developing organisms with optimal
resolution a technique to orient the sample in the microscope in any arbitrary
orientation without affecting the sample integrity is needed. While different
organisms may require tailored solutions, the popular model organism zebrafish is
transparent in the early stages making it the ideal sample for in vivo imaging.<br></div><br></div><div><i>Embedding the work in the literature</i><br></div><div>Microfluidic systems have been developed

with a rotation stage. The entire sample is then reconstructed by fusing views
from several angles. In each view the area facing the objective lens is well
resolved. Consequently, in such a single rotational–axis system uniform
resolution is achieved only along the equator, which faces the detection lens. Therefore
the lateral resolution at the polar caps is no better than the axial resolution
of the microscope (<b>Figure 2b</b>). <br></div><div><br></div><div>Here, we present a remote positioning

technique</i><br></div><div>We think that a positioning method of
biological samples needs to fulfill the following criteria to add a value to
microscopy techniques. The technique needs to add a degree of freedom, which
was not accessible in the microscope to be able to visualize the sample from
the optimal side. Typically microscopes are equipped with a xyz stage to
position the sample in the focal plane of the objective but there is no control
of the sample orientation. The positioning technique must not interfere with
the imaging of the sample. The method should be automatable allowing the
integration in any automated microscopy routine. Ultimately, the technique has
to ensure the sample integrity. While optical methods have successfully
been used to position and to orient single cells for light microscopy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@inproceedings{Torres_Mapa_2012,

forces are not high enough to position
a millimeter-sized zebrafish embryo.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Introduce the idea and show how you go
about implementing it</i><br></div><div>We tried whether we could use magnetic
forces to orient a zebrafish embryo within its chorion. To apply a magnetic
force on the embryo we injected magnetic beads into the yolk. We discovered that
we could orient the injected embryo within its chorion by approaching a permanent
magnet close to the embryo (<b>Supplementary
video S1).</b> The injected beads were attracted by the permanent magnet but the
zebrafish couldn’t translate towards the electromagnet since it was
encapsulated in its chorion. We found that by moving the permanent magnet we
can orient the zebrafish embryo contactless within its chorion.<br></div><div><br><i>Injection of magnetic beads</i><br></div><div><div><div><div>The super paramagnetic beads were
injected with glass needles into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo to ensure the
integrity of the zebrafish embryo. We
performed the injections at 4 hpf and the injection needle was inserted from
either the vegetal pole or the lateral side and beads were deposited close to
the yolk membrane (<b>Figure 1b</b>). We
found that performing the injections at extremely low pressure (5-10 psi) and
long injection duration (100-150 ms) avoided the dispersion of beads. By
applying a strong constant magnetic field after the injection of the beads with
a permanent magnet the beads were attracted and clump. This aggregation of
beads preserved the single beads from translating through the yolk and eased
the rotation.<br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div>
