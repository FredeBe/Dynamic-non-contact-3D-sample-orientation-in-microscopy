<div><i>Limitations of light microscope as
spinning disk</i><br></div><div>In contrast to SPIM, common light
microscopes as spinning disk are designed to image the sample from only one side.
To orient the sample in the preferred orientation and to study the sample from
multiples sides we developed an inset consisting of a plate and an arc holding
the two electromagnets.&nbsp; This inset can
easily be adapted to any commercial light microscope. &nbsp;Here, we show the in situ orientation of a zebrafish
larva (5dpf, kdrl?) on a stereoscope. The magnet orientation could be adapted
continuously by sliding the magnets along the arc. The sample was positioned on
the axis of rotation. The zebrafish larvae was embedded in a glass capillary to
prevent it from translating towards the magnets and to ensure the ball bearing mechanism. &nbsp;<br></div>
