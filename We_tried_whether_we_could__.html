<div>We tried whether we could use magnetic
forces to orient a zebrafish embryo within its chorion. To apply a magnetic
force on the embryo we injected magnetic beads into the yolk. We discovered that
we could orient the injected embryo within its chorion by approaching a permanent
magnet close to the embryo (<b>Supplementary
video S1).</b> The injected beads were attracted by the permanent magnet but the
zebrafish couldnâ€™t translate towards the electromagnet since it was
encapsulated in its chorion. We found that by moving the permanent magnet we
can orient the zebrafish embryo contactless within its chorion. <br></div>
