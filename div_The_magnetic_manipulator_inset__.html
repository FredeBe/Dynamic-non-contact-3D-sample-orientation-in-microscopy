<div>The magnetic manipulator inset was build from a aluminum plate with a size of ??? fitting on standard microscope stages. On this plate an arc holding two electromagnets that can be freely slid along the arc to control the angle between the magnets and the sample. The sample is either placed in a glass capillary to study it on a upright microscope or placed on a coverslip and held by a Teflon holder to study the sample on an inverted microscope. <br></div>
