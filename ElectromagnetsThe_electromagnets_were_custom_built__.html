consisted of a magnetic core made from HyMu 80 alloy (National Electronic
Alloys, USA) and a solenoid. The bobbin was made from Teflon and a high
resistance wire was wind up hundreds of times to create a high magnetic field.
The magnetic core had a diameter of 6mm and was tapered to create a strong
magnetic field gradient. The inner diameter of the bobbin was 6mm that the
magnetic core could be inserted.<br></div>
