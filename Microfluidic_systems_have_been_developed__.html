with a rotation stage. The entire sample is then reconstructed by fusing views
from several angles. In each view the area facing the objective lens is well
resolved. Consequently, in such a single rotationalâ€“axis system uniform
resolution is achieved only along the equator, which faces the detection lens. Therefore
the lateral resolution at the polar caps is no better than the axial resolution
of the microscope. <br></div>
