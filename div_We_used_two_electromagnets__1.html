<div>We used two electromagnets to orient the
zebrafish larva about its anterior-posterior axis making use of the elongated
morphology at the larvae stage. We found that the rotation of the zebrafish
larva worked best with an angle of about 35 degrees between the electromagnet
and the plate. By switching on one magnet the zebrafish was slightly translated
towards the wall of the glass capillary and rotated about 180 degrees towards
the magnet. By switching off the magnet the larvae was released from the force
and settled in its resting position <b>(Figure
3)</b>. A 180 degrees rotation from the left lateral to the right lateral
resting position about the anterior-posterior axis took not longer than 10 s at a current of 1 A. By rotating the
zebrafish larvae we can image the larvae from the right and the left lateral
side within a single experiment. <br></div>
