<h1>Discussion<br></h1><div><br></div><div><div>In summary, we have shown a non-contact
sample orientation method that can orient zebrafish embryos and larvae in
three-dimensions by applying an external magnetic field after the injection of
super-paramagnetic beads into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo. &nbsp;We optimized the protocol for zebrafish
embryos and larvae and adapted the method to a custom-built SPIM and a
commercial stereoscope to enable multi-axes multi-view imaging. A major
contribution of this method is to enable multi-view imaging irrespective of the
microscope used.<br>There are several applications where this
method will be very useful: High-throughput methods <cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Gualda_2015,

of the sample, will greatly profit from our non-contact sample orientation
technique enabling the alignment of all samples in the same orientation
potentially increasing the screening sensitivity and specificity. Similarly,
laser-cutting experiments need a certain sample orientation for precise cutting
of the tissue. Our magnetic manipulator provides full flexibility to orient the
sample as desired in such experiments.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
