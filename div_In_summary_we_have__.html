<div>In summary, we have shown a non-contact
sample orientation method that can orient zebrafish embryos and larvae in
three-dimensions by applying an external magnetic field after the injection of
super-paramagnetic beads into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo. &nbsp;We optimized the protocol for zebrafish
embryos and larvae and adapted the method to a custom-built SPIM and a
commercial stereoscope to enable multi-axes multi-view imaging. A major
contribution of this method is to enable multi-view imaging irrespective of the
microscope used. <br></div>
