<div><i>Intermediate angles</i><br></div><div>To study the sample in the optimal
orientation intermediate orientations between two/three magnets need to be
accessible. We found that these intermediate orientations could be accessed in
two different ways. First, spherical samples with no preferred orientation (as
the zebrafish embryo till the bud stage) could be stopped while rotating from
one magnet to the next one and settled at this intermediate orientation.
Second, by applying a current onto two or more magnets at the same time the
zebrafish oriented to the resulting magnetic field. By changing the ratio of
the applied currents between the different magnets the sample could be
positioned in any orientation in three dimensions. This method is especially
suitable to orient samples in an out-of equilibrium orientation.<br></div>
