<div><b>Sample handling</b><br></div><div><b></b>We oriented the
zebrafish in the chorion and waited till it had oriented what typically took
less than 10s. When the embryo was oriented we switched off the magnet or
reduced the current before starting a stack to avoid any deformations by the
applied force. Switching off typically resulted in a slight reorientation in a
new settle position. After a few seconds when the zebrafish had settled in its
new resting position we started the 3D stack of the zebrafish.<br></div>
