<div><i>Need
to image sample from a specific well-defined angle</i><br></div><div><i></i>Inhomogeneous samples have an optimal orientation when
studied by light microscopy. For example in developmental biology highly
scattering tissues such as pigments, the eyes or the yolk can obscure the organ
or tissue of interest. To align the sample in its preferred orientation the
sample is carefully embedded prior to the experiment. However, after embedding
the sample’s orientation is fixed and cannot be adapted to the sample’s
development during in vivo experiments or to another region of interest anymore.
