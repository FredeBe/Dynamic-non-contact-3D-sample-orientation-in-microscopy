<div>Injections were performed using a micro-injector
and injection needles. The opening of the needle is adjusted such that it is not
too small for the beads to come out as well as not too large to damage the
embryo. Beads are injected at extremely low pressure (~5psi) and long injection
duration (~150ms) in order to avoid dispersion of beads in the yolk. Since the beads sink to the tip of the needle and potentially block the needle the pressure had to be increased for some injections (~25psi)  to prevent blocking of the needle. <br></div>
