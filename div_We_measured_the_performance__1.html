<div>We measured the performance of the
magnetic rotation and found that a rotation of the zebrafish embryo within its
chorion from one magnet to another one (109.5 degrees) took less than 30s at a current as low
as 300 mA <b>(Figure 1)</b>. This transition time from
one magnet to the next one was anti-proportional to the applied current and could
therefore be tuned according to the application. A low current led to slow and
homogenous rotation whereas a high current led to a rapid reorientation. After
releasing the embryo from the magnetic force the zebrafish retracted less than
10s and settled at its final position. We found that the embryo remained stable
in its settled position for over a minute longer than the time it needs to take
a three-dimensional stack of the whole embryo on a SPIM. Applying a low
magnetic force could stabilize the orientation of anisotropic samples in a
preferred orientation.<br></div>
