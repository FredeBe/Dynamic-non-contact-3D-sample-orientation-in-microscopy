<div>The zebrafish embryo in E3 buffer is
sucked up into a FEP tube with a syringe. The inner tube diameter (1.0 mm) is chosen a bit smaller than the zebrafish
chorion (1.2 mm) that the fish is not pulled out of the
tube by the lower magnet. The embryo (0.8 mm) is still free to move within its
chorion.<br></div>
