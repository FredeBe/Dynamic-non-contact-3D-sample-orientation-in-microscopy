spinning disk</i><br></div><div>In contrast to SPIM, common light
microscopes as spinning disk are designed to image the sample from only one side.
To orient the sample in the preferred orientation and to study the sample from
multiples sides we developed an inset consisting of a plate and an arc holding
the two electromagnets.&nbsp; This inset can
easily be adapted to any commercial light microscope. &nbsp;Here, we show the in situ orientation of a zebrafish
larva (5dpf, kdrl?) on a stereoscope. The magnet orientation could be adapted
continuously by sliding the magnets along the arc. The sample was positioned on
the axis of rotation. The zebrafish larvae was embedded in a glass capillary to
prevent it from translating towards the magnets and to ensure the ball bearing mechanism. &nbsp;<br></div><br><div><div><div><i>2 different orientations from the same

                </b></a><br></div><div>We used two electromagnets to orient the
zebrafish larva about its anterior-posterior axis making use of the elongated
morphology at the larvae stage. We found that the rotation of the zebrafish
larva worked best with an angle of about 35 degrees between the electromagnet
and the plate. By switching on one magnet the zebrafish was slightly translated
towards the wall of the glass capillary and rotated about 180 degrees towards
the magnet. By switching off the magnet the larvae was released from the force
and settled in its resting position <b>(Figure
3)</b>. A 180 degrees rotation from the left lateral to the right lateral
resting position about the anterior-posterior axis took not longer than 10 s at a current of 1 A. By rotating the
zebrafish larvae we can image the larvae from the right and the left lateral
side within a single experiment.<br></div><br></div><br></div><br><br></div>
