<div>To ensure the sample integrity no
residual force should affect the sample after it has been oriented. Compared to
ferromagnetic beads it turned out that super-paramagnetic beads show no residual
force once the magnets are switched off since they exhibit magnetic properties
in the presence of a magnetic field with no residual magnetism<sup>7</sup>. The size of these beads needed to be
large enough that the beads are stationary and do not translate within the yolk
when a magnetic field is applied but they should be small enough that they can
be injected without damaging the zebrafish. We found that a bead size of 2.8 Âµm
allows a rotation of the sample with moderate magnetic fields without a
translation of the beads within the zebrafish chorion. The applied force on the
fish is proportional to the number of injected beads hence a higher volume of
beads is favorable but the injected volume may damage the zebrafish. We found that
a volume as low as 1 nl bead solution
corresponding to about 15ng of beads or about 1000 beads is sufficient to
rotate the embryo at low currents of 300mA.&nbsp;
