<div>The washed super paramagnetic beads
(Dynabeads MyOne Carboxylic Acid, Invitrogen) with a diameter of 2.8 Âµm were injected
with standard glass needles into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo. The
injection needle was inserted from either the vegetal pole or the lateral side.
For a sufficient torque to turn the embryo it is important that the beads stay
close to the yolk membrane. Injections were performed at extremely low pressure
(5-10 psi) and long injection duration (100-150 ms) to avoid the dispersion of
beads. By applying a strong constant magnetic field after the injection of the
beads with a permanent magnet the beads are attracted and clump. This
aggregation of beads preserves the single beads from translating through the
yolk and eases the rotation.<br></div>
