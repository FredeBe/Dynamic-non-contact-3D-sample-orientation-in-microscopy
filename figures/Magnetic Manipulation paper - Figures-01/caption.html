<div id="auto-label-caption-264562">Figure 1: Non-contact positioning technique of an zebrafish embryo for imaging from various sides. (a) Four electromagnets (M1,M2,M3,M4) in a tetrahedral geometry assembled around the sample tube (blue). (b) The magnetic beads were injected 4hpf into the yolk of the zebrafish embryo. (c) Bright-field images of a zebrafish embryo encapsulated in the sample tube. The embryo was oriented by applying a magnetic field from magnet M1,M2,M3 and M4, respectively. (d) Kymograph of a reorienting zebrafish embryo. The arrows indicate the time-point when the electromagnet was switched on and off again. The rotation of the zebrafish embryo from one magnet position to the next one (109.5 deg) took less than 30s. After a retraction of less than 10 s the embryo remained stable in its settle position for over a minute longer than the typical duration of stack (5 s) in a SPIM setup.<br></div>
