<div id="auto-label-caption-786643"><b>Figure 2</b> | Non-contact 3D orientation technique adapted to a SPIM system. (<b>a</b>) Schematic showing of the SPIM setup with the tetrahedral electromagnets oriented around the sample tube. The magnets were held by the sample chamber and the sample was illuminated by a light sheet through two windows. The fluorescence was detected through a third window by a detection objective. The sample chamber was motorized to move the sample trough the light sheet and the detection objective was motorized to correct for the different path length in air and water. (<b>b</b>) Schematic representation of the image quality obtained by conventional SPIM by rotating the sample in 90 degree steps about the axis given by the sample tube and fusing the four orientations. (<b>c</b>) Schematic representation of the image quality obtained by our multi-view, multi-axes SPIM technique by rotating the sample in 109.5 degrees given by the tetrahedral magnet geometry. ...<br></div>
