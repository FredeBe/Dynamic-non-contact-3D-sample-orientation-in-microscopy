<div><i>Requirements of an orientation
technique</i><br></div><div>We think that a positioning method of
biological samples needs to fulfill the following criteria to add a value to
microscopy techniques. The technique needs to add a degree of freedom, which
was not accessible in the microscope to be able to visualize the sample from
the optimal side. Typically microscopes are equipped with a xyz stage to
position the sample in the focal plane of the objective but there is no control
of the sample orientation. The positioning technique must not interfere with
the imaging of the sample. The method should be automatable allowing the
integration in any automated microscopy routine. Ultimately, the technique has
to ensure the sample integrity. While optical methods have successfully
been used to position and to orient single cells for light microscopy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@inproceedings{Torres_Mapa_2012,
