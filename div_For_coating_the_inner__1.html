<div>For coating the inner surface
of the FEP tubes with methyl cellulose, 3% methyl cellulose was withdrawn into
and infused out of the FEP tube with a syringe. Thereafter the process is
repeated with E3 buffer to create a thin layer of methyl cellulose on the inner
walls of the tube. Now the fish larva with 200mg/l Tricane in E3 is sucked into
the FEP tube and can be exposed to the magnetic field. Methyl cellulose
prevents it from sticking to the tube and allows the fish to move smoothly
inside the tube.<br></div>
