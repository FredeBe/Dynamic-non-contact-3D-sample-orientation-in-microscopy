<div>Take 10μl
of the stock bead solution (10mg/ml) in an Eppendorf tube. Bring a permanent
magnet close to the tube to clump the beads and remove the remaining solution
using a pipette. Take the magnet away and resuspend the beads in 20μl of distilled water. Repeat the process
twice before injecting the diluted bead solution bead solution (5mg/ml) into
embryo. <br></div>
