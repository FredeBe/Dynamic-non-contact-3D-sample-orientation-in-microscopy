<div>The external magnetic field can be
generated by permanent or electromagnets. Although permanent magnets have a
higher magnetic field, electromagnets can be controlled by the applied current
and hence allow a dynamic adaptation of the magnetic field without any movement
of the magnet. The applied force on a super-paramagnetic bead is proportional
to the magnetic field gradient<sup>7</sup>. Therefore, we sharpened the core of the
electromagnets to create a sufficiently strong magnetic field gradient, even with
a moderate current (300 mA). Heating of the electromagnets was also negligible.
We designed the electromagnets to be small enough to be oriented around the sample
in any geometry giving the freedom of full 3D sample orientation. To study
developing zebrafish from the optimal orientation we adapted our magnetic
orientation technique to a SPIM.<br></div>
