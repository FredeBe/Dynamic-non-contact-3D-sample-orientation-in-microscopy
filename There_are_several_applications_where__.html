of the sample, will greatly profit from our non-contact sample orientation
technique enabling the alignment of all samples in the same orientation
potentially increasing the screening sensitivity and specificity. Similarly,
laser-cutting experiments need a certain sample orientation for precise cutting
of the tissue. Our magnetic manipulator provides full flexibility to orient the
sample as desired in such experiments. <br></div>
