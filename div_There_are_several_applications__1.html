<div>There are several applications where this
method will be very useful: High-throughput methods<sup>9</sup>, which do not offer rotational freedom
of the sample, will greatly profit from our non-contact sample orientation
technique enabling the alignment of all samples in the same orientation
potentially increasing the screening sensitivity and specificity. Similarly,
laser-cutting experiments need a certain sample orientation for precise cutting
of the tissue. Our magnetic manipulator provides full flexibility to orient the
sample as desired in such experiments. <br></div>
