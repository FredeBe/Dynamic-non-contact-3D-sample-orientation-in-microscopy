rotation about which the sample is rotated to take several views. However, a
single rotational-axis system cannot give the full three-dimensional freedom of
rotation. Therefore, not all parts of the sample
can be turned in front of the detection objective and are accessible, e.g. for
photo-manipulation.<br></div>
